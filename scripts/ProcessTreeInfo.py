# You might want to refine what constitutes a suspicious process tree



# In this Python script, you define what you consider to be a suspicious process treeâ€”such as a parent 
# process having an unusually high number of child processes. The script organizes processes into trees
# based on the parent-child relationships and then prints details of any process tree it flags as suspicious.
