"""
This code will run indefinitely, executing the PowerShell script at the interval defined by the interval variable.

Note:
Performance: Running a script that captures all processes at a very frequent interval may impact system performance. You need to balance the frequency of checks with system performance considerations.
Refinement: You will need to refine what constitutes suspicious behavior. This could include unusual memory consumption, unexpected child processes, or processes that should not be running on a given machine.
Alerting: Consider how you will handle alerting in your main application. You may want to implement a logging system or integrate with existing monitoring solutions.
By continuously monitoring processes in this way, you can identify and respond to potential threats in real-time. However, ensure you test thoroughly to refine your criteria for what is considered suspicious and to optimize the performance of your monitoring system.
